# Security Policy

To report security issues with projects under the Pylons Project, send email to: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com.
If we determine that your report may be a security issue with the project, we may contact you for further information.
We volunteers ask that you delay public disclosure of your report for at least seven days from the date you report it to us to allow sufficient time for us to process your report.

Once verified and fixed, we will:

-   report it publically to the MITRE Corporation to its Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) List, which in turn submits those to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
-   make a bug-fix release,
-   and send an announcement through our usual channels, including those listed on the Pylons Project website's [Contact](https://pylonsproject.org/about-contact.html) page.
