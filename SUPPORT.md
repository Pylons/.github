# Support

See https://pylonsproject.org/community-support.html for how to get support.

## General Support

### Mail list / Google Group

For help with Pylons Project projects, and to reach the largest audience (over 2800 participants), including requests for help with your code, you may post to the [pylons-discuss mail list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pylons-discuss).

### Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a question and answer website that is very popular with developers. Questions may be tagged with the project's name, such as [Pyramid](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pyramid) or [WebOb](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webob). You may search for related questions, or ask new questions which will notify the tag's followers.

### `#pyramid` on IRC

Pylons Project developers (10-20 participants) are also generally available on the [#pyramid channel on the Libera IRC Network](https://web.libera.chat/#pyramid).

### GitHub issue trackers

GitHub is the least desirable option. Posting a request for general support to the project's GitHub issue tracker reaches the smallest audience, and takes time away from fixing bugs and adding features. Please don't be "that person".

## Using Support Wisely

Before asking a technical question on a mail list or in IRC, please make sure to try the following things (paraphrased from [Before You Ask](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before)):

- Reading the manual.
- Searching the mail list archives.
- Searching Stack Overflow.
- Searching the Web.
- Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.
- If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

After exhausing these avenues, it's completely appropriate to ask a question on the pylons-discuss mail list or #pyramid and #pylons IRC channels. When you ask your question, please describe what you've learned from the efforts above, as it will help the developers focus on answering your question quickly. It also helps tremendously if you are able to provide a code or configuration snippet that makes the problem easily repeatable.
